### 15.1 Quail Development Kit description

Quail is split into 2 separate programs: QRE - Quail Runtime Environment and
QDK - Quail Development Kit. 

QRE contains the lexer, parser, runtime etc. - all
the things required to run Quail programs and also some developer tools like
documentation generator and debug server. 

QDK contains very specific utilities that are only used during the development
process.
