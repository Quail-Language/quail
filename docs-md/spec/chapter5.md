## Chapter 5: Parsing

Parser is too complicated to be described in separate document, because
this can lead to mistakes and misunderstandings and the documentation
being out of date. Therefore, I've chosen to not document it separately,
but to write docs in its source code. Please proceed to Quail source code.
